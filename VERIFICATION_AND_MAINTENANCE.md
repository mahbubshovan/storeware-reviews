```

## Available Maintenance Scripts

### 1. Verify October 6 Review Fix
**File:** `backend/verify_october_fix.php`

Checks:
- October 6, 2025 review exists in `reviews` table with correct date
- October 6, 2025 review exists in `access_reviews` table
- No reviews with `1970-01-01` dates (or reports count)
- Access reviews table is properly synced

**Usage:**
```bash
php backend/verify_october_fix.php
```

### 2. Sync Access Reviews Table
**File:** `backend/sync_access_reviews.php`

Synchronizes the `access_reviews` table with recent reviews from the `reviews` table:
- Identifies reviews from last 30 days
- Finds missing reviews not in `access_reviews`
- Inserts missing reviews
- Verifies sync is complete

**Usage:**
```bash
php backend/sync_access_reviews.php
```

**When to Use:**
- After manual database changes
- If access_reviews appears out of sync
- After bulk scraping operations

### 3. Fix Remaining Bad Dates
**File:** `backend/fix_remaining_bad_dates.php`

Re-scrapes apps that have reviews with `1970-01-01` dates:
- Identifies which apps have bad dates
- Re-scrapes each app with fixed date parsing
- Syncs access_reviews after scraping
- Reports results

**Usage:**
```bash
php backend/fix_remaining_bad_dates.php
```

**When to Use:**
- To fix remaining `1970-01-01` dates
- After date parsing improvements
- During maintenance windows

## Date Parsing Fix Details

### What Was Fixed
The scraper now correctly handles review dates with "Edited" prefix:
- **Before:** `strtotime("Edited October 6, 2025")` → `false` → `1970-01-01`
- **After:** Extracts date pattern first → `strtotime("October 6, 2025")` → `2025-10-06`

### Implementation
**File:** `backend/scraper/UniversalLiveScraper.php`

New method: `parseReviewDateSafely()`
- Extracts date pattern using regex
- Cleans the date string
- Parses with `strtotime()`
- Returns formatted date or empty string

### Supported Formats
- "October 6, 2025"
- "Edited October 6, 2025"
- "October 6, 2025 at 12:00 PM"
- "Edited October 6, 2025 at 12:00 PM"
- And other common variations

## Monitoring

### Check for Bad Dates
```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root shopify_reviews -e "
SELECT app_name, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM reviews 
WHERE review_date = '1970-01-01'
GROUP BY app_name
ORDER BY count DESC;
"
```

### Check Access Reviews Sync Status
```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root shopify_reviews -e "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews WHERE review_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)) as recent_reviews,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM access_reviews) as access_reviews_count;
"
```

### Verify October 6 Review
```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root shopify_reviews -e "
SELECT id, app_name, store_name, review_date, country_name, rating 
FROM reviews 
WHERE app_name = 'StoreSEO' 
AND store_name = 'AUTOTOC'
AND review_date = '2025-10-06';
"
```
