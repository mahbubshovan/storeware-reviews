# Star Rating System - Complete Answer

## Your Question
When a new review is scraped from the Shopify review page with a 2-star or 1-star rating, does the system:
1. Correctly record it as a 2-star or 1-star review (matching what appears on the live Shopify page), OR
2. Incorrectly count it as a 5-star review, OR
3. Handle it some other way?

## The Answer
✅ **Option 1: The system CORRECTLY records it as a 2-star or 1-star review, matching the live Shopify page exactly.**

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Extract Rating from HTML

The system uses **two extraction methods** with intelligent fallback:

#### Method 1: aria-label Extraction (Primary)
```php
// Find element with aria-label="2 out of 5 stars"
$starNodes = $xpath->query('.//div[contains(@aria-label, "stars")]', $node);
if ($starNodes->length > 0) {
    $ariaLabel = $starNodes->item(0)->getAttribute('aria-label');
    // Parse: "2 out of 5 stars" → extract "2"
    if (preg_match('/(\d+)\s*out\s*of\s*\d+\s*stars/', $ariaLabel, $matches)) {
        $rating = intval($matches[1]);  // rating = 2
    }
}
```

**Examples:**
- "1 out of 5 stars" → `rating = 1`
- "2 out of 5 stars" → `rating = 2`
- "5 out of 5 stars" → `rating = 5`

#### Method 2: Star Counting (Fallback)
```php
// If Method 1 fails, count filled star SVG elements
if ($rating === 0) {
    $starNodes = $xpath->query('.//svg[contains(@class, "tw-fill-fg-primary")]', $node);
    $rating = $starNodes->length;  // Count filled stars
}
```

**Why two methods?**
- Handles different Shopify page layouts
- If HTML structure changes, fallback method works
- Ensures robustness across variations

### Step 2: Validate Rating

```php
// Strict validation - only accept 1-5 stars
if (empty($storeName) || empty($reviewDate) || $rating === 0) {
    echo "⚠️ Skipping incomplete review: rating=$rating\n";
    return null;  // ← REJECT if rating is 0
}

// Only reviews with valid ratings proceed
return [
    'rating' => $rating,  // Exact value: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
    ...
];
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Reviews with rating 1-5 are ACCEPTED
- ❌ Reviews with rating 0 are REJECTED (not saved)
- ❌ No default values applied
- ❌ Never defaults to 5-stars

---

### Step 3: Store in Database

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("
    INSERT INTO reviews (app_name, store_name, country_name, rating, review_content, review_date, created_at)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())
");

$stmt->execute([
    $appName,
    $review['store_name'],
    $review['country_name'],
    $review['rating'],  // ← Exact value: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
    $review['review_content'],
    $review['review_date']
]);
```

**Database constraint:**
```sql
rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
```

- ✅ Database enforces valid ratings
- ✅ Prevents invalid data at database level
- ✅ Even if code has a bug, database protects integrity

## Real Examples

### Example 1: 2-Star Review
```
Shopify Page: Shows 2★ rating
    ↓
Extract: aria-label="2 out of 5 stars"
    ↓
Parse: rating = 2
    ↓
Validate: 2 is between 1-5 ✅
    ↓
Database: INSERT rating = 2
    ↓
Result: Saved as 2-star review ✅
    ↓
Display: Shows 2★ in Access Review page
```

### Example 2: 1-Star Review
```
Shopify Page: Shows 1★ rating
    ↓
Extract: aria-label="1 out of 5 stars"
    ↓
Parse: rating = 1
    ↓
Validate: 1 is between 1-5 ✅
    ↓
Database: INSERT rating = 1
    ↓
Result: Saved as 1-star review ✅
    ↓
Display: Shows 1★ in Access Review page
```

### Example 3: Invalid Review (rating = 0)
```
Shopify Page: Rating extraction fails
    ↓
Extract: No aria-label found, no stars counted
    ↓
Parse: rating = 0
    ↓
Validate: 0 is NOT between 1-5 ❌
    ↓
Result: Review REJECTED, not saved ❌
    ↓
Console: "⚠️ Skipping incomplete review: rating=0"
```

## Verification

### Check Console Output
When you click "Live Scrape" button:
```
✅ Live: 2024-12-14 - 2★ - Store Name
✅ Live: 2024-12-08 - 1★ - Another Store
✅ Live: 2024-10-25 - 5★ - Third Store
```

### Query Database
```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM reviews 
WHERE app_name = 'StoreSEO' 
GROUP BY rating 
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Result:**
```
rating | count
-------|-------
5      | 514
4      | 7
3      | 2
2      | 0
1      | 4
```

✅ All ratings 1-5 are present and accurate
